TLB - translation lookaside buffer
  -small scache solely for holding the page table that are currently being used
  - TLB hit is when page number is found in the TLB...RAM isn't required for translation from virtual to memory
  - TLB miss is when desired page number is not in the TLB so MMU(memory management unit) has to go to the page table
    unit in RAM to retrieve the page frame number

Review:
  Translation
    VA is divided into page number and offset
      all of it goes to MMU
        MMU looks up page frame number corresponding to page number
          reconstructs PA using same offset as before, but uses page frame number instead of page #.->PA in RAM
      - First looks in TLB for frame number, then goes to RAM
  Structure of page table:
      R bit, M bit, page frame number
      page number is index into page table

Structure of TLB
  [valid bit|page #|etc|R|M|page fram #]
  [valid bit|page #|etc|R|M|page fram #]
  [valid bit|page #|etc|R|M|page fram #]
It is an associative cache
  - Look up an entry according to its contents, not its index

Example:
TLB
[v|p#|pf#]
[0|6|#]
[1|4|8]
[1|0|4]
[0|1|#]

Page Table
[present/absent bit|pf#]
0[1|4]
1[0|0]
2[1|15]
3[0|32]
4[1|8]
5[1|19]
6[0|1]



*************************************************************
Suppose you have a machine w/ 16 bit addresses and a page size of 512 bytes.
1) Given an address, how many bits are used for the page number and for the offset
  offset is 9 bits, page number is rest (7 bits)
2) What is the physical address corresponding to the virtual address: 0000100|000001111
page # = 4 
  look up TLB for page # 4
  TLB hit: = 8
           = 1000 binary
0001000|000001111
2a) Was there a TLB hit?
Yes


3) What is the physical address corresponding to the virtual address: 0000001|111101010
TLB Miss
Page table, at index 1, indicates that pageis in memory in page frame 0
physical address is 0000000|111101010

4) What happens i the CPU issues the virtua address 0000010|111111000
  -Page Fault! - page table indicates that page is not in memory, on the disk
   - disk read request
